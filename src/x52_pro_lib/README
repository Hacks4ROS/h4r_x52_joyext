This archive contains the Linux library for the MFD and the
LEDs found on the SAITEK X52 PRO HOTAS joystick. The informations needed
for accessing this nice device were kindly supplied by saitek.

The code is released under the LGPL. For more details please read the
COPYING file.

Compilation of this library requires the libusb http://www.linux-usb.org/

This package includes the udev rules for enabling device access
to the plugdev group members. If x52lib has just been installed it
is likely that udev does not yet know the new rules. If this is the
case the rules can be reloaded with

	sudo udevcontrol reload_rules
	sudo udevtrigger

UPDATE: The library now also supports the old X52 and the new
Saitek Yoke. Since I do not own an old x52 I cannot test it.

With the x52output program it is possible to test all the features
of the library:

x52output text 0 'First Line'
x52output text 1 'Second Line'
x52output text 2 'Third Line'
x52output bri 0 40
x52output bri 1 50
x52output led 1 1   # not available for old X52
x52output time 1 12 20
x52output date 7 10 17
x52output second 30 # YOKE only
x52output offset 0 1 0 90    # set 90 minutes offset on time display 2

The options are described in more detail in x52output(8).

If you have any questions regarding using this library and/or the x52 pro
please send an email to <eduard@hasenleithner.at>. I also welcome
any hints for improvements of this library.
